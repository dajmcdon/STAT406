    "Boosting (a Statistical Learning perspective)\n",
    "=============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notes we will discuss boosting. Our starting point is one its first incarnations (the Adaboost.M1 algorithm). Our goal here is two-fold: introduce boosting as a **different** way of building an **ensemble** of *weak classifiers*, and also to show how a statistical analysis of the method offers valuable insight and opens a wide range of extensions and new methodologies. We follow the presentation in Chapter 10 of \\[HTF09\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "A different kind of ensembles\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course we have seen ensembles of classifiers (or regression estimators) based on the idea of bagging: combininig the predictions of a number of predictors trained on bootstrap samples taken from the original training set. By construction all the predictors in the ensemble are treated *equally* (e.g. their predictions receive the same weight when they are combined). Another characteristic of these ensembles is the predictors in them could be trained in parallel (they are independent from each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting algorithms go back to the late 90s. One of the first ones to appear in the Machine Learning literature is probably *Adaboost.M1* introduced in\n",
    "\n",
    "> Freund, Y. and Schapire, R. (1997). A decision-theoretic generalization of online learning and an application to boosting, *Journal of Computer and System Sciences*, **55**:119-139.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed the specifics of the algorithm in class. An important difference with the other ensembles we discussed in class (**can you name them?**) is that for *Adaboost.M1* the elements of the ensemble are trained **sequentially** in such a way that to compute the i-th predictor *T*<sub>*i*</sub> we need to have the previous one *T*<sub>*i* − 1</sub> available. Furthemore, the weights in the final combination of predictions are generally different for each member of the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use the implementation available in the `adabag` package, specifically the function `boosting`. This function can be rather slow, but it is a straight implementation of the Adaboost algorithm, and it returns many useful objects (e.g. each of the individual weak lerners, etc.) As usual, I suggest that you invest a few minutes reading the help pages and also *exploring* the returned objects by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Adaboost was originally proposed for 2-class problems. To illustrate its use, we look at the zip code digits example. We consider the problem of building a classifier to determine whether an image is a *1* or a *9*. We use 1-split classification trees as our *weak lerners* in the ensemble. Since `boosting` uses the `rpart` implementation of classification and regression trees, we use the function `rpart.control` to specify the type of *weak lerners* we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first load the full training set, and extract the *7*'s and *9*'s. Since the original data file does not have feature names, we create them as \"V1\", \"V2\", etc."
