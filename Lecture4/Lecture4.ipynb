    "In other words, the coeffficients of explanatory variables that appeared\n",
    "to be relevant in one model may turn to be “not significant” when other\n",
    "variables are included. This could pose some challenges for interpreting\n",
    "the estimated parameters of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does this happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the covariance matrix of the least squares estimator\n",
    "involves the inverse of (X’X), where X’ denotes the transpose of the n x\n",
    "p matrix X (that contains each vector of explanatory variables as a\n",
    "row). It is easy to see that if two columns of X are linearly dependent,\n",
    "then X’X will be rank deficient. When two columns of X are “close” to\n",
    "being linearly dependent (e.g. their linear corrleation is high), then\n",
    "the matrix X’X will be ill-conditioned, and its inverse will have very\n",
    "large entries. This means that the estimated standard errors of the\n",
    "least squares estimator will be unduly large, resulting in\n",
    "non-significant test of hypotheses for each parameter separately, even\n",
    "if the global test for all of them simultaneously is highly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this a problem if we are interested in prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in many applications one is interested in interpreting the\n",
    "parameters of the model, even if one is only trying to fit / train a\n",
    "model to do predictions, highly variable parameter estimators will\n",
    "typically result in a noticeable loss of prediction accuracy. This can\n",
    "be easily seen from the bias / variance factorization of the mean\n",
    "squared prediction error (MSPE) mentioned in class. Hence, better\n",
    "predictions can be obtained if one uses less-variable parameter (or\n",
    "regression function) estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used strategy is to remove some explanatory variables from\n",
    "the model, leaving only non-redundant covariates. However, this is\n",
    "easier said than done. You will have seen some strategies in previous\n",
    "Statistics courses (e.g. stepwise variable selection). In coming weeks\n",
    "we will investigate other methods to deal with this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing models – General strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of competing models from which we want to choose\n",
    "the “best” one. In order to properly define our problem we need the\n",
    "following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - a list of models to be considered;\n",
    "  - a numerical measure to compare any two models in our list;\n",
    "  - a strategy (algorithm, criterion) to navigate the set of models; and\n",
    "  - a criterion to stop the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in stepwise methods the models under consideration in each\n",
    "step are those that differ from the current model only by one\n",
    "coefficient (variable). The numerical measure used to compare models\n",
    "could be AIC, or Mallow’s Cp, etc. The strategy is to only consider\n",
    "submodels with one fewer variable than the current one, and we stop if\n",
    "either none of these “p-1” submodels is better than the current one, or\n",
    "we reach an empty model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing models – What is AIC?\n",
    "\n",
    "One intuitively sensible quantity that can be used to compare models is\n",
    "a distance measuring how “close” the distributions implied by these\n",
    "models are from the actual stochastic process generating the data (here\n",
    "“stochastic process” refers to the random mechanism that generated the\n",
    "observations). In order to do this we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  a distance / metric (or at least a “quasimetric”) between models;\n",
    "    and\n",
    "2.  a way of estimating this distance when the “true” model is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIC provides an unbiased estimator of the Kullback-Leibler divergence\n",
    "between the estimated model and the “true” one. See the lecture slides\n",
    "for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using stepwise + AIC to select a model\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply stepwise regression based on AIC to select a linear regression\n",
    "model for the airpollution data. In `R` we can use the function\n",
    "`stepAIC` in package `MASS` to perform a stepwise search, for the\n",
