## PIAZZA and WebWork
- You can register in the course's [PIAZZA](https://www.piazza.com) page via
[Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca).
- In order to use WebWork to practice with the quizzes you need to ...
(more to come later).
<!-- register via
[Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca): go to the course Canvas page, click on
*Assignments*, then on *WebWork Link*, and finally click on *Load WebWork Link on a new window*.
This is a **necessary** step (don't shoot the messenger!) but you only
need to do this **once**. -->

## Useful tools
- [R](http://www.cran.r-project.org/): This is the software we will use in the course. I will assume that you are familiar with it (in particular, that you know how to write **your own functions** and **loops**). If needed, there are plenty of resources on line to learn R.
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/): The IDE (integrated development environment) of choice for R. Not necessary, but helpful.
- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org). "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text."
You can use these to interactively run and play with the lecture notes and the code to reproduce all the examples I use in class. This is not necessary, but may be helpful. There are two options to run notebooks: (1) locally on your own computer; or (2) on a remote server:
    1. Follow the instructions
[here](https://jupyter.org/install.html) to install Jupyter on your laptop. You will also need to follow [these instructions](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r) to install the `R kernel` for Jupyter.
    2. Alternatively, you can run the notebooks on the [syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) server. There are Julia, Python 2, Python 3, and R kernels available (although we will only use the R one). Sign in with your UBC CWL. Once you are logged in, use [this link](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/msalibian/STAT406) to clone this repository (STAT406) (including all notebooks) directly onto your [syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) home directory. You  **will** need to do this regularly throughout the Term,
	as the notebooks may (will?) change during the Term.
