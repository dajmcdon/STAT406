If we using *B* bootstrap samples, we will construct *B* classifiers, and given a point **x**, we now have *B* estimated conditional probabilities for each of the possible *K* classes. Unlike what happens with regression problems, we now have a choice to make when deciding how to combine the *B* outputs for each point. We can take either: a majority vote over the *B* separate decisions, or we can average the *B* estimated probabilities for the *K* classes, to obtain bagged estimated conditional probabilities. As discussed and illustrated in class, the latter approach is usually preferred.\n",

Each ensemble is constructed in exactly the same way we did in the regression case. For the first ensemble we train `NB = 1000` trees and store them in a list (called `ts`) for future use:"
